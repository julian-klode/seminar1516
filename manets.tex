\section{Introduction}
Mobile Ad-Hoc networks are blah blah.

A recent survey\cite{alotaibi2012survey} on routing protocols for wireless
ad hoc networks describes the following six categories for routing protocols:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Geographical
  \item Geo-cast
  \item Multi-Path
  \item Hierarchical
  \item Power-aware
  \item Flow-Oriented
  \item Hybrid
  \item WMN
  \item Multicast
\end{enumerate}
-- in addition to the classic categories of proactive (that is, table driven)
and reactive (that is, on demand) routing protocols.

Most of these categories are not focused on energy efficiency, but more on
other factors such as fault tolerance, scalability and performance. The only
category in which energy efficiency is discussed is that of power-aware algorithms.


\section{Categories}
\subsection{Geographical routing}
The basic idea behind geographical routing is that nodes are addressed by
their geographic location instead of an IP address. This has the advantage
that each node does not need to know the full network topology, but each
node needs to know its location and each source needs to know the location
of the receiver.

Geographical routing does not consider energy efficiency, as such it makes
no sense to discuss them further.

\subsection{Geo-cast}
Geo-cast routing merges multi-cast routing with geographical routing, to
deliver messages to a group of nodes identified by their locations.

\subsection{Hierarchical RA}
A hierarchical routing algorithm defines multiple zones or clusters with
gateways that connect them with each other. Inside a cluster, there often
are one or more cluster heads, that are responsible for maintaining the
connectivity within the cluster. Non-head nodes can only communicate with
their cluster heads, whereas gateway nodes can exchange information with
other clusters.


\subsection{Multi-path}
In a multi-path routing algorithms, multiple paths exists from one source
to a destination. The obvious advantages of a multi-path routing
algorithm include fault tolerance (if one path fails, another is still in
use), load distribution (congested routes can be avoided by chosing alternative
routes), peak performance (multiple routes may be used in parallel for different
parts of data).

Energy-efficiency is not a paramount concern of most multi-path routing, the
load balancing idea can however not only be applied to performance, but also
to power levels, to distribute the power used within the network, as we will
see later on. Such an algorithm would of course also be power-aware.

\subsection{Power-aware}
A power-aware routing algorithm tries to find a good trade off between
power consumption of nodes and mobility. \cite{main1} describes two categories
of power-aware protocols: those that try to minimise the active communication energy -- either
by controlling the power used for transmission, or by load control -- and
algorithms that try to minimise the inactivity energy, for example, by putting
rarely used nodes to sleep.


\section{Protocol survey}
\subsection{Transmission power control}
\subsubsection{Flow argumentation routing (FAR)}
Flow argumentation routing (FAR) was discussed by Chang and Tassiulas\cite{chang2000energy};
\subsubsection{Online max-min (OMM)}
OMM was discussed by Li, Alsam, Rus\cite{li2001online};
\subsubsection{Power aware localized routing (PLR)}
Discussed by Stojmenovic and Lin \cite{stojmenovic2001power};
\subsubsection{Minimum energy routing (MER)}
Discussed by Doshi, Bhandare, Brown \cite{doshi2002demand};
\subsubsection{Retransmission-energy aware routing (RAR)}
Discussed by Banarjee and Misra \cite{banerjee2002minimum};
\subsubsection{Smallest common power (COMPOW)}
Discussed by Narayanaswamy, Kawadia, Sreenivas and Kumar\cite{narayanaswamy2002power};

\subsubsection{PARO}
The PARO Protocol\cite{gomez2003paro} introduces intermediate nodes into a
route, increasing the length of the route, in order to reduce the transmission
power required by each node.

\subsection{Load distribution}
\subsubsection{Local Energy Aware Routing Protocol (LEAR)}
Woo et al. introduced LEAR\cite{woo2001non},

\subsubsection{Conditional max-min battery capacity routing (CMMBCR)}
Too introduced CMMBCR\cite{toh2001maximum}.

\subsection{Sleep/power­ down mode}
\subsubsection{SPAN}
Span\cite{chen2002span} is \ldots

\subsubsection{Geographic adaptive fidelity (GAF)}
GAF\cite{xu2001geography} is \ldots{}

\subsubsection{Prototype embedded network (PEN)}
PEN\cite{girling2000design} is \ldots

\subsection{Uncategorised}

\subsubsection{Energy Saving Dynamic Resource Routing Protocol (ESDSR)}
ESDSR\cite{tarique2005energy} \ldots
\subsubsection{Local Minimum Energy Dynamic Source Routing Protocol (MEDSR)}
MEDSR\cite{tanque2007minimum} \ldots

\subsubsection{Energy Efficient Routing Protocol in MANET (EERP)}
Suvarna and Naik introduced EERP, a routing protocol with a horribly
generic name\cite{main2}.

\section{Conclusion}
There are many different approaches to energy-efficient routing in
mobile ad-hoc networks. Current research seems to focus on protocols
that minimise active communication energy, and mostly on those that
rely on power control rather than load control.
